# Building Modern React Websites with Gatsby.js

Gatsby is a JavaScript framework for creating wicked fast, modern websites with React and GraphQL.

Gatsby makes it easy to build a website with all of today's best practices at the forefront - not an after thought. This includes code splitting, pre-loaded routes, image loading and compression, offline ready and so much more. Along with amazing user experiences, the gatsby developer experience is fast, hot-reloaded and easily deployable.

Together we will build a Gatsby.js based website from scratch, learning the core concepts and understanding how to tackle a website. This includes:

* How to source data from Headless APIs or static markdown files.
* Writing GraphQL Queries
* Image Compression Plugins
* Templating and Theming
* Layouts with React Components
* CSS with Styled Components
* Building & Deployment
* + more!

This workshop is a must for anyone looking to build modern websites all while sharpening their React skills. This includes you, WordPress devs!

## Pre-workshop Prep

You should have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

Go ahead and download the starter files and notes from <https://github.com/wesbos/gatsby-workshop>. I recommend downloading these files and not forking the repo as we will be creating a repo as part of the workshop.

Then, cd into the `gatsby-site` folder and run `npm install`. If you run into any issues, shoot me an email wes@wesbos.com or show up ~25 mins early to the workshop and we can make sure you are in a good spot to start the workshop.

That's it! See you at the workshop.
